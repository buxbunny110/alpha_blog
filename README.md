### How to boot:

1. bundle 
2. rails s

and of course you have to have Ruby installed, on Mac/Linux use rvm or rbenv, after installation switch to ruby version which is used in the project, this case version 2.6.5

**If you're on windows and getting some build errors from the bundler I got a solution, just switch your OS unless you're ~~.NET dev~~, it's not worth it**
